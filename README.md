### Life is a Mandelbrot

![Mandelbrot Set](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Animation_of_the_growth_of_the_Mandelbrot_set_as_you_iterate_towards_infinity.gif)

    Life is not so simple and plain,
    So I'll take help of the complex plane.
    With the domain having its edges fixed,
    Doesn't our timeline also has a limit?

    Iterating each point on this very plane,
    Some points vanish and some escape;
    But there are few points stubborn enough,
    Who continue to circle around and say that the iteration is not enough.
    They depict the problems which we face in our lives,
    Some vanish, some grow and some with which we compromise.

    Pour colours in this fractal array, and see,
    The beauty comparable to the daughters of Eve.
    You will realise, life is not so pale, my dear,
    The diversity and colour surely gives us a reason to cheer.

    Still our Soul is just like a sailing boat,
    Travelling endlessly on the never-ending borderline of Mandelbrot.

:pencil: I wrote this poem way back in 2011, when I was just a story-teller with no knowledge of Data Science.   
Fast forward present day, I help firms create stories from their data which I cannot share due to contractual obligations.  
But, what I can still share are some of my [old] stories:
- [The Third Wave](http://ankitmahato.blogspot.com/2012/06/third-wave.html)
- [The Brick Tea](http://ankitmahato.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-brick-tea.html)
- [Love, Strategy and Antaragni](http://ankitmahato.blogspot.com/2013/04/love-strategy-and-antaragni.html)
- [She fell in love .. Just because he was an IITian!](http://ankitmahato.blogspot.com/2012/08/she-fell-in-love-just-because-he-was.html)

Enjoy!
