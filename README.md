### Life is a Mandelbrot

![Mandelbrot Set](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Animation_of_the_growth_of_the_Mandelbrot_set_as_you_iterate_towards_infinity.gif)

    Life is not so simple and plain,
    So I'll take help of the complex plane.
    With the domain having its edges fixed,
    Doesn't our timeline also has a limit?

    Iterating each point on this very plane,
    Some points vanish and some escape;
    But there are few points stubborn enough,
    Who continue to circle around and say that the iteration is not enough.
    They depict the problems which we face in our lives,
    Some vanish, some grow and some with which we compromise.

    Pour colours in this fractal array, and see,
    The beauty comparable to the daughters of Eve.
    You will realise, life is not so pale, my dear,
    The diversity and colour surely gives us a reason to cheer.

    Still our Soul is just like a sailing boat,
    Travelling endlessly on the never-ending borderline of Mandelbrot.
